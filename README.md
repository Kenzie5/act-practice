# act-practice
An application to run ACT practice tests

Individual Project Charter
The individual project I would like to tackle for this class is an SAT/ACT practice testing app. I have a family member in my life that will be taking standardized tests soon and it is my hope I can create a program which will help with the practice that goes into such an endeavor. I would like the app to give feedback on how the user is doing with the questions and pull the questions manually from a practice book or a database. The capabilities of the test will be to give a full timed test or do a specific timed section of the test. I am leaving whether I go for the ACT or SAT open until I figure out which one I can get the questions for more easily but once it is decided it will only focus on one test and not the other. The feedback it will give will include scores.
