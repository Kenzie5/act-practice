Bar Codes: A Linear History
[1]
In 1948, graduate (1){students, Norman Woodland
and Bernard Silver,} took on a problem that had troubled
retailers for years: how to keep track of store inventories.
Inspired by the dots and dashes of Morse code, (2){however,}
Woodland and Silver created a system of lines that could
encode data. Called a symbology, the pattern created by
the spacing and widths of the lines encodes information
by representing different characters.
[2]
The first bar code was composed of four white
lines set at specific (3){distances from each other} on a black
background. The first line was always present.(4)
Depending on the presence or absence of the remaining
three lines, up to seven different arrangements were
(5){susceptible} and, therefore, seven different encodings.
Today, twenty-nine white lines (6){making} more than half
a billion encodings possible.
[3]
To create a bar code scanner, Woodland and
Silver adapted technology from an optical movie sound
system. Their prototype scanner used a 500-watt bulb, a
photomultiplier tube (a device that detects light), and an
oscilloscope (a device that translates electronic signals into
readable information). Although successful, the (7){concoction}
was both large and costly. (8){For example,} progress stalled
until the 1970s, when laser technology (both more compact
and less expensive) became available.
[4]
In today’s scanners, a laser sends light back and forth
across a bar code. While the black lines absorb the light,
the white lines reflect (9){it} back at a fixed mirror inside the
scanner. In this way, the scanner reads the symbology and
decodes the information.
[5]
(10)Today,
(11){being that there are} one- and
two-dimensional bar codes using numeric
and alphanumeric symbologies. Bar codes
are used not only for a pack of gum or an airline
ticket, but also for research. In one study, for
instance, tiny bar codes (12){were placed on bees tracking}
their activities. Shaping the way we gather, track, and
share information, (13){we have almost certainly exceeded
even Woodland and Silver’s expectations.}

Glowing on an Adventure
As I pulled my camera out of my backpack, I felt a
tap on my arm.
“No photographs,” whispered the woman next to
(16){me, pointing} up to the cave ceiling. “The flash will
make them stop (17){glowing,” she said, whispering.}
She was referring to the thousands of glowworms
that clung to the limestone ceiling and, with their radiant
bodies, flooded the cave in aquamarine light. (18){While}
I was traveling (19){on} canoe on a group tour through
the renowned Glowworm Grotto of New Zealand’s
Waitomo Caves. Were it not for the twinkling
light of these Arachnocampa luminosa, a species
unique to New Zealand and abundant in these caves,
this meandering subterranean passageway would
(20){feel as though it were downright ensconced in shadows.}
I sheepishly tucked the camera away and focused
again on the glowworms. Collectively, they resembled the
cosmos, a sea of stars in a clear night sky. Beautiful—yet
what made them glow?
“Bioluminescence,” the woman said,
peculiarly sensing my curiosity.(21) A badge
(22){was} pinned to her shirt indicated she was a
biochemist, here, I guessed, to research the organism.
She explained that to attract prey, glowworms (not
really worms at all, but the larval stage of a fungus
gnat) emit light through their translucent (23){skin; via} a
cellular chemical reaction. The cells produce luciferin,
a chemical pigment that reacts with oxygen to produce
light that shines through the organism’s tail-end intestine.
From its mouth, she showed me,
(24){all glowworms dangle} shimmering silken
threads glossed in beads of mucus. Cave-dwelling
insects are (25){trapped in these threads, then reeled in
like fish on a line, and finally lured by the light.}
The light responds to environmental factors. The
sound of splashing water, (26){however,} might signal
that prey is nearby, causing (27){them} to
brighten.(28)
Our trip neared its end. I spotted
a dragonfly (29){in the cave.} I knew its
(30){fate,} it would be ensnared, just as I had
been by the brilliance of these luminescent
glowworms.

A Rose by the Name Antique
With shears in hand, I clip a thin branch
from the rosebush in my backyard garden. I place this
clipping into the (31){basket next to me} and crouch under
(32){this} again. I snip a few more branches and then rise
to head to the greenhouse. There, I will deposit these
clippings in rich soil; roots will take hold, (33){buds will sprout,}
and a new plant will find a home in my garden.
My roses are not your average hybrid-tea roses (those
long-stemmed, special occasion roses with well-formed
buds). Mine are antique (34){roses, old, or heirloom varieties,}
that have existed in gardens worldwide for centuries.
Compared to (35){vibrant hybrid-tea colors,} antique rose colors
tend to be (36){silenced.} Their stems are also shorter, and their
buds are a bit droopier. Their fragrance, however, is
unmatched. And unlike the hybrid-tea whose long stems
make (37){into} a rosebush that is rather scraggly looking,
antique rosebushes (38){can be grown in a variety of colors,}
handsomely landscaping gardens.
(39){The plant thrives best when it is exposed to six hours
of direct sunlight daily.} The plant can withstand extreme
temperatures and survive nearly anywhere. (40){It’s} also easier
to grow antiques. Cultivating hybrid-teas (41){having involved}
a process of grafting two species of rose together, but the
grafted area remains weak and susceptible to viruses.
Antiques, on the other hand, are less prone to disease
because they are grown simply by placing cuttings from
a parent plant into nutrient-rich soil. (42){They require} far less
pruning, fertilizing, and nurturing than their hybrid-tea
counterparts, antiques can reportedly survive without any
care from human hands, (43){a fact that surprises many.}
[1] I dig small holes in a pot of soil, place each
clipping a half inch deep, and pack down the soil around
them. [2] Back in my greenhouse, I strip the clippings
of all leaves and branches. [3] Then I wait: the roots will
take hold and, eventually, buds will sprout.(44)

Jeremy Frey, Weaving Heritage Into Modern Art
[1]
The winning piece was a basket, (46){it was} eighteen
inches tall with a curved, vaselike silhouette. [A] It
was made of ash wood finely woven into bold stripes of
black and white that ran from its crown to its base. [B]
In the ninetyyear
history of the Santa Fe Indian
(47){Market—the largest Indian art festival in the nation—}the
2011 event marked the first time a basket won best of
show. The creator of the piece, thirtythreeyearold
Passamaquoddy Indian Jeremy Frey from Princeton,
Maine, (48){the} basket sold at auction for $16,000.
[2]
[C] Frey describes his baskets as
“cutting-edge traditional.” [D] He primarily
weaves a classic material, wood from the brown
ash tree, (49){but, unlike most contemporary basketmakers,}
he harvests, cuts, pounds, dries, and dyes the wood
himself. (50){Then creating} highly elaborate versions
of the sturdy utility baskets that have been used
by (51){generations of Passamaquoddy} fishermen from
Maine. He honors tradition, but he highlights
artistic design. For example, his baskets feature
(52){complex weaving on} areas that are often hidden
and therefore typically not embellished. Many
traditional baskets have basic, woven lids.
Frey’s (53){porcupine quill} lids are often decorated
with art inlaid on birch (54){bark; as far as lids go,
I wouldn’t say that’s basic.} And while braids of
grass (55){are} customarily woven into ash baskets
(56){to make them better,} Frey incorporates braided
cedar bark to create striking new textures.
[3]
Now that he’s a nationally recognized artist (57){of who}
has rejuvenated the art of basketry, Frey feels his role
is to inspire. He’s on the board of the Maine Indian
Basketmakers Alliance, a group that works to help
preserve (58){it} by reaching out to young members of Native
communities in the state. His other goal is to continue to
(59){stand out.} The woven grass bracelets he saw on a recent
trip to Hawaii have influenced how he shapes the bases
of some of his newer baskets, as he finds yet another way
to make traditional Passamaquoddy weaving something
spectacularly his own.

The Flow of Time
Nine hundred years (61){ago, Emperor Zhezong of China,}
ordered the design and construction of a clock
(62){built to keep time more accurately than other clocks.}
This would be no simple (63){timepiece and because}
Chinese dynasties (64){continued} to astrology, they relied
on complicated clocks that not only kept time but also
helped track stars, planets, the sun, and the moon. An
(65){eminent scientist and bureaucrat named Su Song lead}
Zhezong’s ambitious project.
(66){Using his expertise in calendrical science,}
Su Song created a spectacular timepiece (67){housed within}
an ornate forty-foot-tall tower. At the tower’s top sat an
armillary (68){sphere, or} a nest of metal rings representing
celestial reference points such as the horizon and
the sun’s path—that rotated in sync with the
earth, enabling precise astronomical observations.
Inside the tower, a sphere depicting the sky
revolved to display the stars that were overhead.
(69){Besides,} below the star sphere, the tower’s open
sides exposed a detailed model of a five-story pagoda.
Automated figurines would appear in the pagoda’s
doorways and ring (70){bells to announce} hours, sunsets,
seasons, and other chronological events.
The clock’s inner workings (71){were} equally remarkable.
Hidden in the tower, a waterwheel eleven feet in diameter
powered the entire clock. (72){Therefore, water} would pour at
a constant rate into one of the wheel’s thirty-six buckets.
When the bucket was full, the water’s weight pulled it
down, rotating the waterwheel. Then a stop mechanism
halted the wheel and positioned the next bucket for filling.
Chinese clockmakers had long used waterwheels, (73){but}
Su Song’s stop mechanism, which regulated the inertia
of the waterwheel, represented significant innovation.
Unfortunately, after Su Song’s clock ran
for thirty years, invaders stole it. Later the clock
vanished altogether. It would be a few hundred years
(74){until with the refinement of mechanical clocks in Europe}
other clocks (75){approached the complexity} of Su Song’s
masterpiece.
